# <Travel-Destinations>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- Our motivation for creating this project is our interest in traveling and sometimes figuring out where to go and what to do at certain travel locations can be a challenge.

- This project was created to provide a tool to help users have an easier time with travel planning.

- This project helps to improve travel planning and to attract more visitors to potential travel destinations that could be hidden gems.

- Through this project we were able to learn more about using GitHub to collaborate on Web Development Projects. We were also able to apply coding skills in the following languages: HTML, Javascript and CSS. Using CSS frameworks was also something new that was learned through this project and modification to a CSS framework to present it to our vision.
